# Space Age Calculator (TDD Demo)

#### This project is to demonstrate my ability to set up an envirnoment via node webpacks to create projects and to test my code (via Jest) using TDD standards.

## Technologies Used

* Github
* Gitbash
* Virtual Studio Code
* HTML
* Markdown
* Jquery
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* Node.js
* Jest
* Web Pack

## Description

Using a barebones UI, the user will input an age. From there the code will then take that age, and create an object that will convert that age to a year (rounded up) for Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter.  A 2nd object is created and takes a predefined Earth life average (78) and converts it for the other planets. This is all then appended to the UI.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

Using your Github account, go to your Gitbash terminal and use the: $git clone https://github.com/JuanHasZem/SpaceCalcDemo command to download a copy of the files used for this project. Then open the file labeled index.html to open the website and test the page out.

Alternatively, follow this link: [SpaceCalcDemo](https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/SpaceCalcDemo)

Additionally, some node module are required.
* To install Node and Webpack dependencies, enter into the terminal: $ npm install
* Once installation is complete, build the program environment with: $ npm run build
* Finally, to open the application on a developer server in your browser type: $ npm run start
 * Note: If running this on a PC, open up the package.json file and find the following line: "start": "npm run build; webpack-dev-server......" replace the "build;" with "build & ".
 * Additionally, if you wish to test the code you enter ``$ npm run test`` this will run Jest on the program and check if the tests (stored in the __tests__ folder) work or not, as well as displays what % of the code is tested.
